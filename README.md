# Cotton-Price-Prediction (using Machine Learning).
## Supervised Learning Algorithm (Regression).
- This project was built on Decision Tree and Random Forest Algorithm.
- In this we have taken Characteristics like Year, District, Variety, Date, Month and Modal Price.
- we have used Data Visualization technique using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Finall the model gives us the accuracy of 90% while predicting the price.
