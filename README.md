# Cotton-Price-Prediction (using Machine Learning).
## Supervised Learning Algorithm (Regression).
- This project was built on Decision Tree and Random Forest Algorithm.
- In this we have taken Characteristics like Year, District, Variety, Date, Month and Modal Price.
- we have used Data Visualization technique using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Finall the model gives us the accuracy of 90% while predicting the price.

## Data Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
### State Gujarat.
we can see here the price range of Cotton in different Districts.

# Predictions.

## Predictions are seen in the frontend of the website based of Django.

we can see 12 month price of crop in a certain district.

we can also see all the district 12 month price of a certain crop.
